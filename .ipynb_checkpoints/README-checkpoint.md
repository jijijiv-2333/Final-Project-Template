El Ni単o has been a very well known and influential oceanographic phenomenon, its root cause is the weakening of trade winds. 
	During El Ni単o, trade winds weaken. Warm water is pushed back east, this results in surface warming of the east tropical Pacific Ocean, weakening the Humboldt current (4~45 degreed south), thus weaking the upwelling of the west coast of South America.
	Without the nutrients from the deep, there are fewer phytoplankton off the coast.
	 To explore the exact extent of the impact in primary production caused by El Ni単o
	In time of El Ni単o, weaker Humboldt current and weaker upwelling seems to result in a more spread-out nutrient thus more spread-out phytoplankton distribution. 	The population decreased obviously in the near coastline, but hard to tell whether the phytoplankton or the primary production decreased or not in a larger scale.
